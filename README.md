<h1><b>The Story in the Book</b></h2>

    <h2><b>Chapter 1</b></h2>
    <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature, New scientist,</i> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It has been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wide quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the Ilama <abbr acronym="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
